^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0.3.3 (2016-09-09)
------------------
* [fix] Define shared_ptr typedef (adjusting to the recent change in urdfdom) `#18 <https://github.com/ros-planning/srdfdom/issues/18>`_
* Contributors: Dave Coleman, Robert Haschke

0.3.2 (2016-08-25)
------------------
* [feat] Move SRDF-specific commands from moveit package `#14 <https://github.com/ros-planning/srdfdom/issues/14>`_
* [sys] remove ROS-dependent logging.
* [sys] Much cleanup in package.xml. `#12 <https://github.com/ros-planning/srdfdom/issues/12>`_ pkg-config is no longer used after https://github.com/ros-planning/srdfdom/commit/19b23e5900e9c179089e99caae52023f95d2fec8#diff-af3b638bc2a3e6c650974192a53c7291

0.3.1 (2016-08-01)
------------------
* Change logError to Warn if collision link missing `#10 <https://github.com/ros-planning/srdfdom/issues/10>`_ Since MoveIt continues to load anyway, it makes sense to change the unknown collision link pairs ROS Error to a ROS Warning. Everything continues to work if a specified set of collision-link pairs is missing.
